# Unagiii
Some program I made to help me pick up a random episode to watch from a series.
(Pretty straightforward, but it gets the job done)

## Unagiii.exe
The executable "Unagiii.exe" searches for video files in the main folder plus all the subfolders, then launches a random one of them.
If you just organise your files and folders, this should do the trick.

## Side Note
This mini-project came to life while I and two of my friends were watching random episodes of... well... FRIENDS.
